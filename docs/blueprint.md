## Original User Request:
make me a cool, modern day react portfolio that will be used to display my skills, resume, and contact info. I want it to be impressive, with design elements and parralax effects. I want the user to scroll to each section, and not have it all jammed in one page. Add graphics if possible! Shaders and textures are cool. I want this to be creative AND professional
